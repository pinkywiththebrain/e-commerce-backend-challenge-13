  ## Description
  For this assignment I was instructed to create the backend routes and data base for an online shop. I had to create each model and their associations  for the database as well as each get, post, put, and delete route for the site. This allows the user to insert, view, update, and delete data freely on the front end.

  ## Demo Video

  ## Installation Instructions
  Must first run npm i to install needed packages. Then run the schema file to use the database. Then seed the data using npm run seeds. After everything is installed and the database is set up you can start the server and test the routes on Heroku.
  
  ## Usage
  See above.
